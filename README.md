# Global Hack Week : Build your own UI Component Library

This is a Global Hack Week project aimed at creating a UI Component Library utilizing:

- Vite
- React
- Tailwind-CSS

# Setup

1. Make sure to `npm install` while in the root directory
2. To run the project, enter `npm run dev` into the terminal

# Development

To test locally whether the library is working correctly or not, follow these steps:

1. Locally build the project with `npm run build`
2. Run `npm pack` to create a tarball. A file something like `ghw-components-library-vl-test-1.0.0.tgz` should be generated in the root directory.
3. Locally install the package with `npm add ghw-components-library-vl-test-1.0.0.tgz`. You should see the package added to `dependencies` in `package.json`.
